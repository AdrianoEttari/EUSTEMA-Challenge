# EUSTEMA-Challenge

In this repository you can find different folders:

* notebooks: here there are four jupyter notebooks (2 for the preprocessing of train\_od and train\_s and 2 for the models applied on each preprocessed dataset)  and one R markdown (just for the MARS model applied on train\_s, because we had problem in making the corresponding libraries working in python).
