# EUSTEMA-Challenge

In this repository you can find different folders:

* notebooks: here there are four jupyter notebooks (2 for the preprocessing of train\_od and train\_s and 2 for the models applied on each preprocessed dataset)  and one R markdown (just for the MARS model applied on train\_s, because we had problem in making the corresponding libraries working in python).

* DATA: here there are all the needed data-set for running the notebooks. More precisely, in order to run the preprocessing ones, you just need train\_s.csv and train\_od.csv. To run the models notebooks you need final\_train\_od\_dummies.csv and final\_train\_s\_dummies.csv. Moreover, there is a data\_for\_plotting.csv file that we used to make interesting visualizations in Tableau.

* models: in this folder you will find the weights of the fitted models.
